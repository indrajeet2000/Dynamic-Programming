Dynamic Programming is a technique in computer programming that helps to efficiently 
solve a class of problems that have overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure property.

There are some rules which makes it easier to identify the question if its DP or not

DP always has recursion and if the quetions states:
find max, largest, smallest, any thing which inputs to take or not take that has several complex repeatation 


DP = recursion+memoization+ (may be) tabulation i.e. top down/bottom up for space complex
